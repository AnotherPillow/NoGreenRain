# NoGreenRain

A mod that allows the disabling or forcibly enabling of green rain.


## Configuration

- `AlwaysGreenRain` - if true, will make green rain *always* occur. If false, will make green rain *never* occur.
- `AlternativeIsSun` - if `AlwaysGreenRain` is set to false, and this is set to true, it will make days that would've been green rain sunny. If set to false they will be rainy instead.
